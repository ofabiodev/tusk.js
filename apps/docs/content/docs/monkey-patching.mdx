Monkey patching is a technique that allows you to modify code at runtime by changing classes, modules, or functions.
It enables you to extend or modify the behavior of existing code without altering its source files directly.

## Understanding Monkey Patching

Think of monkey patching like applying a temporary patch or modification to a running program. 
Just as you might patch a tire without replacing it, monkey patching lets you modify code behavior without changing the original source code.


### Basic Example
```ts title="example.ts"
// Original code
const MathHelper = {
    add(num: number, num2: number) {
        return num - num2
    }
}

// Monkey patching
MathHelper.add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Use with Caution">
  Monkey patching, while powerful, comes with significant risks:
  - Can lead to hard-to-debug issues if not properly tracked
  - May break when the original code is updated
  - Can cause unexpected behavior in production
  - Makes code harder to maintain and understand
  
  Always document your patches and consider them as temporary solutions rather than permanent fixes.
