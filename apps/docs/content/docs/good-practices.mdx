Monkey patching is a **powerful tool**, but with great power comes great responsibility! üï∑Ô∏è 
Here are some **best practices** to ensure your patches are safe, maintainable, and effective.

---

## Use Sparingly
Monkey patching should be a last resort, not a go-to solution. Always consider alternatives like:
- **Wrappers:** Create a wrapper function or class around the original code.
- **Middleware:** Use middleware patterns to extend functionality.
- **Pull Requests:** Contribute fixes or features directly to the library.
**Why?** Overusing patches can make your codebase harder to maintain and debug.

## Document Your Patches
Follow the **3W** rule:
- **Why** the patch was applied.
- **What** the patch does.
- **When** it was added and by whom.

### Example:
```typescript title="fix.ts"
import { patch } from "tusk";

const MathHelper = {
    add(num: number, num2: number) {
        return num - num2
    }
}

/**
 * Patch: Fix incorrect subtraction in MathHelper.add  
 * Reason: The original method subtracts instead of adding.  
 * Author: John Doe  
 * Date: 2025-28-2 
 */
patch(MathHelper, "add", function(_original, a, b) {
    return a + b
});
```

## Test Thoroughly
- **Isolate Patches:** Test patches in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
- **Edge Cases:** Test edge cases to catch unexpected behavior.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure patches don‚Äôt break other parts of the application.
**Why?** Patches can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to detect.

## Unpatch When Done
Always restore the original behavior when the patch is no longer needed.
Use Tusk‚Äôs `unpatch` method to clean up.

```ts title="unpatch.ts"
// Apply patch
patch(Array.prototype, "flat", function (original, depth) {
    const flattened = original.call(this, depth); 
    return flattened.map(() => 0); 
});

// Unpatch when done
unpatch(Array.prototype, "flat");    
```

## Communicate with Your Team
- **Code Reviews:** Discuss patches during code reviews to ensure they‚Äôre necessary and well-implemented.
- **Documentation:** Share documentation about patches with your team.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use clear naming conventions for patched methods (e.g., `_patchedMethod`).

## Avoid Side Effects
- **Global Changes:** Be cautious when patching global objects (e.g., Array.prototype).
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Avoid patching third-party libraries unless absolutely necessary.
- **Performance:** Ensure patches don‚Äôt introduce performance bottlenecks.

**üß† Pro Tip** ‚ï∫‚ï∏ Document every patch and its purpose‚Äîfuture you (and your team) will thank you!
